## Newyork-Real-Estate-Insights-Forecasting
This project explores historical property listings in New York using the realtor-data-ny.csv dataset. Conducted in Python, the analysis focuses on three core tasks: identifying key trends through summary statistics and visualisations, building a regression model to predict property prices, and developing a classification model to determine whether a property is located in New York City, without using direct geographic variables. The aim is to extract actionable insights and demonstrate how data-driven methods can support real estate forecasting and strategic decision-making.
